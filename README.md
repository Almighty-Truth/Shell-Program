# Shell-Program 
This project is a Linux shell script that performs division on user-inputted numbers and writes the results to a file. It also analyzes the first 1500 lines of two different files to count the number of occurrences of "ACGT". The purpose of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in shell scripting and file analysis.
